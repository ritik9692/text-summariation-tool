    <h1>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h1>
    <p><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong> is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and produce human language.</p>
    <p>NLP combines computational linguistics—rule-based modeling of human language—with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models.</p>
    <p>These technologies enable computers to process human language in the form of text or voice data and 'understand' its full meaning, complete with the speaker or writer's intent and sentiment.</p>
    <p>NLP is used in applications such as speech recognition, machine translation, sentiment analysis, chatbots, and more.</p>
    <p>The ultimate goal of NLP is to help computers understand language as well as humans do.</p>
